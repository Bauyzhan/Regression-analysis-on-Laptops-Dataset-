# Regression-analysis-on-Laptops-Dataset-
The dataset was scrapped from the website,which is specialized on laptops.The data was entirely parsed from this website on 7 features(screen_size,RAM,brand_name and etc) and one target variable as price.As a result,exploratory data analysis,web scrapping using bs4,cleaning of dataset and regression analysis was held.

Firstly,You should see parsing.ipynb file where I webscrapped laptop-related data and conducted preprocessing.

Secondly,you should see ml.ipynb file, where I've done data cleaning,vizualizations and implemented regression algorithm with and without hyperparameter tuning using optuna.
